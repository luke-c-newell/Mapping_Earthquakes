# Mapping_Earthquakes
This repository contains code for a recent earthquakes map, which charts tremors that have been recorded over the past 7 days. Using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Leaflet and D3, I have plotted data from the U.S. Geological Survey website as seen on the maps below.

## Functionality
There are 3 main ways that the map can be adapted to offer a different perspective on recent geologic activity.

1. There are three overlays on the map, the earthquakes overlay, the tectonic plates and the strongest earthquakes dataset (over 4.5 on the Richter scale). Each of these can be turned on and off, enabling the user to determine whether they would like to see the entire visualization or any combination of the three. Each of these overlays is on by default and they can be turned off by hovering over the box in top right hand corner and selecting/deselecting each one.
2. The map layer can be alternated between three different options: Streets map, Satellite map and Dark map. The Streets map is on by default and can be changed by hovering over the box in top right hand corner and selecting a different map option.
3. Each earthquake reveals its precise location and magnitude when a user clicks on the icon on the map. To remove the popup, click on any empty space on the map.
