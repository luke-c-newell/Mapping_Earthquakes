# Mapping_Earthquakes
This repository contains code for a recent Earthquakes map, which charts tremors that have been recorded over the past 7 days. Using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Leaflet and D3, I have plotted data from the U.S. Geological Survey website as seen on the maps below.

## Functionality
There are 3 main ways that the map can be adapted to offer a different perspective on recent geologic activity.

1. The three layers on the map can each be turned off and on, enabling the user to determine whether they would like to see the entire earthquakes dataset, the tectonic plates or just the strongest earthquakes. Each of these layers is on by default and they can be turned off by clicking the box in top right hand corner.
